## Assignment Details

This repository contains the code and documentation for Home Assignment 1. The assignment covers the following tasks:

1. **Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping**: Create, reshape, and perform operations on tensors.
2. **Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement and compare Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) loss functions.
3. **Training a Model with Different Optimizers**: Train an MNIST model using Adam and SGD optimizers and compare their performance.
4. **Training a Neural Network with TensorBoard Logging**: Train a simple neural network on the MNIST dataset and log results to TensorBoard.

The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and is provided in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files. Below are the steps to run the code locally (in Jupyter) or on Google Colab.

## Files

- `Task1_Tensor_Manipulations.ipynb`: Code for Task 1.
